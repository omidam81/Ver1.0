        Description: Example, your default site culture is en-US and you have content localized as ru-RU. For visitors from Ukraine (uk-UA) or Belarus (be-BY) much preffereble would be to show content in ru-RU when en-US, because almost people know russian language. The same situation can happen with other cultures
